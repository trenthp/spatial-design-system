# Spatial Design System Explorer

An interactive WebXR experience exploring fundamental UI patterns for spatial computing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

As spatial computing platforms mature (Meta Horizon OS, Android XR, visionOS), we need standardized interaction patterns. This project documents explores and demonstrates three critical patterns:

1. **Billboard UI** - Interface elements that always face the user
2. **Diegetic Menus** - Controls fixed in 3D world space  
3. **Distance Scaling** - UI that adapts size based on proximity

## ðŸš€ Try It

**Desktop:** https://trenthp.github.io/spatial-design-system/
- Use WASD to move, mouse to look
- Click objects to interact

**Mobile:** Open the same URL on your phone
- Tilt phone to look around
- Stare at objects to select (hands-free!)

## ðŸ›  Built With

- A-Frame 1.5.0 - WebXR framework
- GitHub Pages - Hosting
- Pure HTML/JavaScript - No build process needed

## ðŸ’¡ Design Decisions

**Why These Patterns?**
- Every spatial OS needs them
- Cover 80% of UI use cases
- Demonstrate different depth treatment strategies

**Why WebXR?**
- Zero-friction distribution (just a URL)
- Works on phones without app install
- Platform-agnostic (works on Quest, desktop, mobile)

## ðŸ“š Learnings

- Billboard UI is powerful but disorienting if overused
- Diegetic menus require careful distance calibration
- Mobile testing is critical - desktop doesn't reveal motion sickness issues
